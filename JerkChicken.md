Super Tasty Coconut Jerk Chicken and Sweet Potato
=================================================
What you will need should you choose this adventure:
----------------------------------------------------

    1 lb of chicken breast cut into medium-sized chunks
    The creamy milk of a coconut or a tin of coconut milk
    2 sweet potatoes cut into smallish chunks
    1 medium onion finely chopped
    1 Jerk

How to make a jerk:
-------------------

    4 tbsp allspice
    1 tbsp thyme
    1 tbsp paprika
    2 tsp cayenne pepper (more, if you were forged from the fires of Mordor, Mr. Frodo)
    [this is supposed to be scotch bonnet peppers, so all the better if you can get those!]
    1 tsp onion powder
    1 tsp garlic powder
    1 tsp salt
    ¼ tsp Cinnamon
    ¼ tsp nutmeg
    ¼ tsp black pepper

_This will make a lot of jerk seasoning, you'll probably get a few runs through this dish before you run out._ Combine all the spices together in a small bowl. Hurrah. You want it to be too hot if you taste it straight. The coconut milk, fat from the meat and the rice will all temper the heat.
 
How to make the other thing:
----------------------------

Rub enough of the dry jerk spice mix into the chicken breasts to completely cover the chicken. 
If you don't like the feel of animal flesh, this could be somewhat unpleasant, so you might 
consider putting the chicken in a bowl, pouring the spice over, and mixing it up with a spoon... 
or a stick... or anything that keeps you and the flesh from coming in contact... like another 
person. Heat up some oil in a frying pan over a medium flame. Put the chicken in and cook on 
each side until it's starting to brown. Add the onions. Cook the chickenand the onions until 
the onions are translucent. Add the sweet potato chunks and continue cooking for another couple
of minutes. Pour in the coconut milk (with a dash more jerk seasoning if you have it around) 
and mix it all up well. Simmer for about 30 minutes. 

Serves up well with rice.
