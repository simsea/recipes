Fish Chowder
=============
_makes about 6-8 servings_

### Things Required

    1 tbsp olive oil
    1 tbsp butter
    2 medium onions chopped
    2 tbsp flour
    ½ cup dry white wine (optional)
    3 large yukon gold potatoes (1¼ lbs), peeled and cut into ¾" cubes
    2 cups clam juice
    1 bay leaf
    1 tbsp fresh thyme or 1 tsp dried thyme
    1½ tsp salt
    ¼ tsp ground black pepper
    1 tsp Old Bay (or a little paprika and cayenne pepper)
    1½ to 2 lbs cod or other firm white fish (sustainable) cut into 2" pieces
    1½ cups heavy cream
    2 tbsp chopped parsley

### Things to do

Heat the oil and butter in a large pot and sauté onions until softened (about 5 minutes). Add the flour and mix well. Add the wine (if using) and turn up the heat, cooking uncovered until the win reduces by half. If not using wine, add ¼ cups water with the clam juice.

Add potatoes, clam juice, bay leaf, thyme, salt, pepper, and Old Bay spice. The potatoes should be just barely covered with the liquid in the pot. If not, add a little water so that they are. Bring to a simmer then lower the head and cook, covered, until the potatoes are almost done (about 10-15 minutes).

In a separate pot, heat the cream until steamy, but not boiling.

Add the fish to the pot of potatoes and add the heated cream. Cook on low heat, uncovered, until the fish is just cooked through (about 10 minutes). Keep an eye on the heat. If you're using straigh heavy cream, it should be easier to avoid curdling. Keep the temperature so that it gets barely steam but not simmering. When the fish is cooked through, remove from heat. Mix in the parsley and let rest for about 30 minutes.
