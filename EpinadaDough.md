Empinada Dough
=================================================
_Makes 12 pastries_

### Ingredients

    2¼ cups of unbleached all-purpose flour
    1½ teaspoons of salt
    1 stick (½ cup) cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces
    1 large egg
    ⅓ cup of water
    1 tablespoon of distilled white vinegar

### Do That Thing You Do

Sift flour and salt together into a large bowl and blend in butter. I use
a food processor and pulse until the butter is pea-sized chunks.

Whisk the egg, water, and vinegar together in a small bowl and then add to the
flour mixture. Blend with a fork until just incorporated. The mixture will look
"shaggy".

Turn out onto a lightly floured surface, gather together, and kneed a few times
with the heel of your hand until the dough can be brought together into a ball. Form
the dough into a flat ractangle, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate for at least an
hour.

When ready to use, cut into 12 equal pieces, roll the small pieces into little balls,
and roll out into circles on a lightly floured surface.
