French Dinner Rolls
===================
_makes 16, ~30 minutes prep, ~2 hours waiting, ~20 minutes cooking_

### Ingredients

    1½ cup warm water
    1 tbsp active dry yeast
    2 tbsp sugar
    2 tbsp olive oil
    1 tsp salt
    4 cups bread flour

### Directions

Mix the warm water, yeast, and sugar. Let stand for 10 minutes. In a large bowl
combine yeast mixture, salt, oil, and 2 cups of the flour. Stir well to combine
then add the remaining flour ½ at a time, combining well with each addition.
Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic 
(about 8 to 10 minutes). Lightly oil a large bowl and place dough in and turn to
coat with oil. Cover with cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled 
(about 1 hour). Punch down (deflate) dough and turn out onto a floured surface.
Divide dough into 16 equal pieces (~63g) and form into rounds. Place rolls onto
a lightly oiled baking sheet about 2" apart. Cover rolls with a cloth and let
rise until doubled (about 40 minutes). Preheat over to 400°F and bake rolls for
about 18 to 20 minutes until golden brown.
