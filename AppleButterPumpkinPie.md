Sharon's Kick-Ass Apple-Butter Pumpkin Pie
==========================================
_Makes one 9-inch pie (8 servings)_

### For the pie crust:

    1½ cups flour, plus more for dusting
    1 stick (½ cup) chilled unsalted butter, cut into pieces
    ¼ teaspoon salt
    3 tablespoons ice water

### For the filling:

    1 cup canned pumpkin
    1 cup apple butter
    ¼ cup maple syrup
    ½ teaspoon salt
    ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
    ¼ teaspoon nutmeg
    3 eggs, lightly beaten
    ⅓ cup cream
    ⅔ cup milk

### For the pie crust:

In the bowl of a food processor, combine the flour, butter, and salt. Pulse
just until the mixture resembles coarse meal. With the motor running, add
the ice water in tablespoon increments, until the dough comes together but
has not yet formed a ball. Transfer the dough to a work surface and shape 
into a disk, handling the dough as little as possible. Lightly dust with 
flour on both sides and wrap in waxed paper or plastic wrap; refrigerate 
for at least 1 hour or up to 1 day.

When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 400°F. Have ready a 9-inch 
pie plate.

On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the dough to a round about 1/8 
inch thick and about 11 inches in diameter. Transfer to the pie plate, and 
use your fingers to create a crimped edge. Set aside.

### For the filling:

In a medium bowl, combine the pumpkin, apple butter, maple syrup, salt and 
cinnamon and mix well. Add the eggs, cream, and milk, stirring to combine. 
Pour the filling into the pie shell. Bake for 45 to 50 minutes or until the 
center has set. Cool completely before serving or storing in the 
refrigerator.
